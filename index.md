## Welcome to the Aksozlu-Foley Gallery

## Have you ever wondered what a robot would make of our normal human behaviour, our passions?

## Images

### Project 1:
If Pablo Picasso were alive today, how would he portray the modern world?

This painting folds in Pablo Picassos unique style and take on the world with the 21st century's 'Information Age'.

Description on how this painting relates to human passion aka social media (maybe instead a photo of twitter posts).
This is to do with the dark side of passion (can explain perhaps the image search is explicit images - picasso's blue phase?) - the red lighting around the computer representing joy in the activity of being immersed in ones computer, but the blue-ish hue of the search results indicates an unhealthy addiction. It is interesting that the model trained on picasso's images registered the negative vibe of the set-up, where a person would not perceive this. Picasso invented a new style each time he fell in love with a woman - Arthur Danto. The fact that it came out so dark and depressing is interesting - perhaps a reflection on modern day passion in comparison to the Picasso era of traditional romance. Picasso was obviosuly a very distressed person and his paintings are a window into that mindset so putting a very normal everyday image through this model, we can view this everyday image through the lense of depression and this is the result. 






## Project 2:
Here is our first attempt to bring the life of an oryx in a Qatari desert to you through a depth field view...

## Project 3:
The legend of Atlantis... if we told a computer it existed, how would it imagine this mystical land (pardon the pun)?

![Fish in a big city](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95362392/161055487-f92809ba-ef7d-4baa-8371-78f70710c8c6.jpg)

Something about how artificial intelligence allows us to dream up scenarios that we could never truly visualise or even fully understand the details of how this would work in our own minds. Here we have combined an image of a school of fish with one of the world's busiest and most vibrant cities - Tokyo. The result - an underwater metropolis.
