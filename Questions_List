Questions for Ed:


1. NFTs - is it enough to just mint the NFTs for the 5 marks? - YES
2. Social Media Presence - Is it necessary to have the artwork on multiple social media platforms for more marks, or is it equally viable to just have say on instagram?
3. Does he mind if we have our own url or not i.e. is github.io fine to use or more marks for custom url?
4. Elevator pitch - is this individual or given jointly in the group? - GIVEN JOINTLY
5. Is our theme too broad? (Human Passion) - THEME IS FINE, SUBTHEME FOR EACH PROJECT

From Zoom with Ed:
1. Target each project at a specific audience
2. Use more than 1 final picture for each project - details of creation will be talked about in REPORT
3. Give ourselves a collective name rather than INM707_blabla (e.g. Artificial Passion - The Aksozlu_Foley Gallery)
4. Get a good looking website domain name (for Wix)
5. Social Media - Facebook, Instagram, Etsy, NFT-link is enough. Paypal links are fine for payment.
6. Do not mention it is coursework in any of the pages.
7. For depression - German expressionism: post WW1.
